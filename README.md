I'm a software developer with around 12 years of experience building web applications. Currently, I am working at [@mp-ac](https://github.com/mp-ac) as part of SeringalLab, our innovation lab.

I'm developing AI Agents and artificial intelligence tools such as Anton.IA, a conversational AI powered by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and TranscreveAI, a transcription platform that uses Whisper model to convert audio into text.
