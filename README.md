I have about 10 years of experience developing web applications. Now I'm developing artificial intelligence tools at @mp-ac, like Anton.IA, a conversational AI tool powered by RAG, and TranscreveAI, which transcribes audio using OpenAI's Whisper model.

Additionally, I work on fine-tuning language models to customize AI responses and adapt them to MPAC's specific context and needs. This involves training models with local data to deliver more accurate and relevant results.
